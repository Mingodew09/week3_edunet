Final Project 

# Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered **Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System** using **Python** and **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)**. The system helps farmers make **data-driven decisions** for selecting the most suitable crops and fertilizers based on **soil properties, climate conditions, and nutrient requirements**.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Machine Learning Libraries:**  
  - Scikit-learn – Model training & implementation  
  - Matplotlib – Data visualization  
  - Seaborn – Statistical insights  

## Methodology
### **1. Data Collection**
- Gather soil data, climate conditions, and historical crop yield records.
- Use publicly available datasets or agricultural research sources.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values and standardize data formats.
- Perform **feature selection** for optimized model performance.
- Visualize data using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**.

### **3. Model Building**
- Implement **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)** using **Scikit-learn**.
- Develop separate models for **crop recommendation** and **fertilizer recommendation**.

### **4. Model Training**
- Split data into **training (80%) and testing (20%) sets**.
- Train the model using relevant features like **soil pH, moisture, and climate conditions**.

### **5. Model Evaluation**
- Assess accuracy using metrics like **precision, recall, F1-score**.
- Achieved **98.49% accuracy** for crop recommendation.
- Achieved **100% accuracy** for fertilizer recommendation.

## Problem Statement
- **Diverse Agricultural Land:** Farmers struggle to choose the right crops for their soil type.
- **Multiple Crop Options:** Not all crops are suitable based on environmental conditions.
- **Fertilizer Optimization:** Selecting the right fertilizer is critical for soil health.
- **Data-Driven Farming:** AI-based recommendations improve **efficiency, yield, and sustainability**.

## Solution
- **Green Skills with AI**: Combines AI-driven **Decision Tree algorithms** to enhance precision farming.
- Achieved **98.49% accuracy** in crop recommendation and **100% accuracy** in fertilizer selection.
- Helps farmers **choose the best crop and fertilizer** to maximize yield and profitability.

## Future Scope
- Extend the model by integrating **Random Forest and Deep Learning techniques** for improved accuracy.
- Enhance **feature selection** and optimization for more **robust recommendations**.
- Real-time **IoT-based soil monitoring** for adaptive predictions.
- Deployment as a **cloud-based API or mobile application** for farmer accessibility.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the **power of AI in precision agriculture**, enabling farmers to **make data-driven decisions** for better yield and sustainability. With **future enhancements**, including **advanced AI models, real-time monitoring, and policy integrations**, this system can evolve into a **scalable solution for smart farming**.
